Hardware
    CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz
    RAM: 64.0 GB

Locking strategies
Two locking strategies were used, both with a single mutex but with different granularity.
The first one (called MUTEX_WRAPS_EVERYTHING) performs an entire sale registration inside its lock.
The other one (called MUTEX_WHEN_NECESSARY) only performs read/write operations on the registered sales, money sum and inventory inside the lock,
and performs initializations and calculations outside its mutex lock.

Test parameters
Each strategy was tested against similar amounts of data, but randomized each time.
Test data: 200 types of products
           200-400 products of each type
           50 registered sales for each product type
           1-3 products (of the same type) sold per registered sale
Number of threads used: 5, 20, 50
