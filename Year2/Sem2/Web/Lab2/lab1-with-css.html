                <h2>Introduction to climbing</h2>
                <p>
                    Climbing is a pretty new sport compared to giants like football and tennis.
                    It has maybe the simplest rules in any sport: use the given holds to climb up a wall.
                    While this has been practiced by humans long before our time, it only recently became a
                    fully accepted sport, with its first appearance in an olympic format at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
                    But, since they were postponed, the climbing world has to wait for the next edition.

                <h2>Different schools of climbing</h2>
                <div>
                    At first glance, climbing always looks the same. But in reality, there are more schools of climbing:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lead climbing</li>
                        <li>Bouldering</li>
                        <li>Speed climbing</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Historically, <b>lead climbing</b> came the first. It involves scaling huge mountain faces using certain means
                    of safety. Lead climbing is done in pairs, with the person on the wall being <em>belayed</em> by the one
                    on the ground. Initially, this would be done by wrapping the rope around your body to catch your partner's
                    fall. Nowadays, we have highly specialized harnesses that don't get in your way and also provide a lot of extra
                    slots for additional equipment that you have to bring up the route.

                <p>
                    <b>Bouldering</b> came second. This school of climbing involves much shorter routes, but at significantly higher
                    intensity. It gets its name from the boulders that climbers found and tried to climb on in certain areas of
                    France, the UK and the US. Here, climbers use crash pads to catch their fall, since ropes would be of little
                    use at such low altitudes.

                <p>
                    The last, and maybe most controversial school of climbing, is <b>speed climbing</b>. It involves climbers training
                    for a long time on a set route and then competing for the fastest ascent. The route itself is easy, because
                    it was intended to find a lot of optimisations in the way you climb it.

                <h2>Body types and climbing</h2>
                <p>
                    What do climbers look like? We know basketball players are tall, cyclists have huge legs and weightlifters are bulky.
                    Well, in the climbing world, there is quite a variety of body types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, skinny athletes seem to be
                    on par with more muscular ones, as strength is measured in a ratio with body weight. Height sometimes provides
                    an advantage when reaching for far away holds, but it can also encumber the climber when having to get into
                    a tighter spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For day-to-day people, climbing is actually quite a low entry level sport. Sure, a lot of routes require huge
                    amounts of strength, but easier ones rely a lot more on the correct usage of your feet, to lessen the load on
                    your arms. It is also an amazing way to build strength while having fun!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What could definitely affect climbing performance, however, is the so-called <b>ape index</b>. This is a measure
                    of the difference of length between your arms and your height. Longer arms generally mean you can reach holds much easier,
                    while being possibly short. This gives you the best of both worlds, but it is something quite rare. Also, a possible
                    caveat is that longer arms are more fragile and build up strength slower than shorter arms.
                </p>

                <h2>Nutrition in climbing</h2>
                <header>
                    Having said all that, how should a climber fuel his body for optimal performance?
                </header>
                <p>
                    This is a question that will have a different answer for everyone. Generally, a high-protein diet is definitely
                    a must, since protein is used by our bodies to repair muscle tissue, but what else? A good approach is to
                    respond to what your body tells you: if you feel too tired during your training session, you might be running
                    low on carbohydrates, as well. Make sure to grab a quick snack, and next time eat better a few hours before training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hydration is also an extremely important subject. Both water and the food you eat will determine if (and how often)
                    you will suffer from injuries. Our fingers are almost always under heavy load. If we don't eat properly, they get
                    weaker and are more prone to injuries, such as tendon sprains.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    A very big problem among climbers is the everlasting fear of not being slim enough. We all know that the most
                    successful climbers are generally much slimmer than us, but somehow still possess huge amounts of strength.
                    Seeing this, a lot of climbers go through stages of anorexia, which actually hinders their progress because of
                    the sudden loss of weight.
